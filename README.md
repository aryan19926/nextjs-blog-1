# nextjs-blog

A blog example using Next.js and BaseHub.

## Notes

- It should look the same as https://app-router-contentful.vercel.app/
- You can structure the code in a similar fashion as the [contentful example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-contentful).
- You should use [Pump](https://basehub.com/docs/api-reference/basehub-sdk#fast-refresh-with-pump) to get the content that you'll render.
- Any doubts or roadblocks, write them down! This exercise is important for us to improve our docs, guides, SDKs.
